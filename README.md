# HelpAtEase

This app allows two types of users namely for an NGO and the other for volunteers. 

The NGO can upload their events on the app along with the required details which are further available to the interested volunteers. If 
a certain event makes them interested and they want to volunteer for it then they can register for that event. After registering for the event,
now the details ofthe volunteer are avaialble at the NGO side for the respective events. All the details of the volunteer which mostly includes contact 
information is available to the NGO.
